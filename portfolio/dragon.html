            Dragon Fruit / The goal of this project was to brand a produce item, with specific focus on the depth of the brand’s personality.

            Dragon fruit seems to have "originated" in many places around the globe, and their link is unknown. This inspired the magical, ancient feel of my rebrand, where I hoped to make a lore of the dragon fruit in lieu of its actual history.
