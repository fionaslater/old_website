    <p>
      The goal of this project was to brand a produce item, with specific
       focus on the depth of the brand’s personality. I wanted to use the
       whimsy of the name without being cliche. When researching its history,
       I learned that there really isn’t one. Dragon fruit seems to have
       "originated" in many places around the globe, and their link is unknown.
       This inspired the magical, ancient feel of my rebrand, where I hoped to
        make a lore of the dragon fruit in lieu of its actual history. My central
        theme was archaic drawings, taken from a field guide drafted in an ancient
        world of dragons. The field guide documents the dragon’s rule, the fruit’s
        role as their source of power, and its eventual placement into our modern
        world. I used the magic to emphasize the nutritional value and built off the
         memorable look and allure of the fruit. I created both digital drawings and
        designs in Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Sketch, and Procreate, as well as physical
        drawings, and used Photoshop to merge them into the theme of the field guide.
