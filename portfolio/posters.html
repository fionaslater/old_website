    <p>
      I wanted to shift the narrative of the opioid addiction campaign to awareness for those who care
      about the person with the addiction. I figured that if your loved ones could see you were in physical
      pain or danger, they would know to help, but sometimes the pain or danger cannot be seen so easily.
      What does interior pain look like? For every one person struggling, there are many who would want to
      help if they were aware of the struggle, so I created a visual for those who may not understand what
      an addiction looks like.

      I decided to create a monster to represent addiction. This monster controls, tempts, and allures itâ€™s victim,
      hidden from others and following them through life in all situations. I did this to raise awareness that
      addiction is separate from the addict and does not define them. The reflection aspect represents that while
      an addiction can be difficult to see, it is always there and leaving traces.
