      Mineral is a digital agency with disciplines in web development and marketing. The brand strives for an identity of mentorship and guidance, offering services to help piece together ideas. I wanted to capture this
      identity in their logo, hence the different shaped shards that together form a cohesive, defined figure. I also wanted to keep it in line with their name, so I chose this sedimented marble-esque shape to be the overall figure.
I have always admired art nouveau, the 19th century, intricate style of organic lines and curves. Long before digital design, all the details, including the lettering, had to be painted by hand. So when I was given the opportunity
to recreate a poster digitally, this was the perfect candidate. To pay homage and ensure resemblance, I used Adobe Illustrator to paint the entire poster, a modern twist on the old technique, which shows that even with similar methods, the precision gifted by the digital era is a substantial change. Notice the clips above. The left is the original, hand painted image. The right is my vectorized, digitally painted recreation. Same style, new feel.
