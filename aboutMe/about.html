            <h3>Hi I'm Fiona. I am a Technology, Arts, and Media Design major
              at the University of Colorado Boulder. I have a passion to create and design
              through painting, digital art, and drawing. I love to take mundane objects and turn them into something extraordinary
              that tells a story. I focus on pushing myself to break through what is “normal” and strive to find
              a different way to see the world around me. I am passionate about working with those who do good and seek to influence
              positve change with my work. My inspiration for creating art orginiates from the places and people I love,
              and I am excited to see more beautiful places and meet more remarkable people. </h3>
