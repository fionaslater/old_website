            <h3>Throughout my time as a Technology, Arts, and Media Design major at the University of Colorado Boulder I have gained a passion to create and design through painting,
digital art, and drawing.

<br/>
<br/>

I love to take mundane objects and turn them into
something extraordinary that tells a story. I focus on pushing myself to break through what is “normal” and strive to find a different way to see the world around me.

<br/>
<br/>

I am passionate about working with those who do good and seek to influence positve change with my work.

<br/>
<br/>

My inspiration for creating art orginiates from the places and people I love, and I am excited to see more beautiful places and meet more remarkable people. </h3>
